## Future Enhancements

* Accept HTML Format

* Use RubyGems API to get gem information.
  * Should show current version, available version, and latest version.
  * Hyperlink the gem name to RubyGems.

* Accept path to Gemfile/Gemfile.lock.
  * This should be the default behavior
  * We could bundle up the Gemfile/Gemfile.lock and pass it to the script
    * Probably better to parse Gemfile/Gemfile.lock and refer to Rubygems info.
  * Support URLs to Gemfile/Gemfile.lock
